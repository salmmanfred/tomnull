This is a program that combines together 2 files.
  
This program also tells you what lines in File1 are changed.
  
After compiling the program add target/release(or debug) to PATH.
  
The program works in the way that you call it then give it the file1(the file that will be changed)
  
Then you give it file2 the orgin file that will change file1 it will then tell you what is diffrent about the 2 files.
  
After that you can continue to combine them or do nothing.
  
Feel free to test it on other operating systems and changing it to work on other operating systems.
